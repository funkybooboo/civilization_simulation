# Civilization Simulation

## Summary

Echoes of Eden is a civilization simulation. The simulation starts with a small, stable village in the middle of a
forest. Each person in the village has a set of tasks they can do, including gathering resources, building structures, 
having a family, and exploring. They are also aware of various personal metrics such as health, hunger, and family 
status. Villagers choose what tasks to do based on these personal metrics, and by using various epsilon-greedy 
algorithms.

The simulation uses a 2D array to map the village and keep track of where each villager is. As villagers move around the
map, they can remember which structures they have passed. They use this memory to know where to find things later and 
determine what tasks need to be done. Villagers also have an inventory that enforces a limit on how many resources they 
can carry at a time.

After a set amount of iterations (mimicking some amount of years), the simulation will finish and print graphs and 
statistics about the village. The purpose of these is for use in analyzing how successful the simulation's 
decision-making algorithms are at keeping the village alive and thriving.

## How to Run

This program uses poetry to manage dependencies. Before running the program, install poetry. Then install the program's 
dependencies using `poetry shell` and `poetry install`. 

All settings used throughout the program are stored in `example.dev_settings.yaml` (the settings used during 
development) and `example.prod_settings.yaml` (the settings used during production). Before running the program, change 
these file names to `dev_settings.yaml` and `prod_settings.yaml`.

Then, to run the simulation, run `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 src/main.py`. The simulation will take some time to complete. 
You will get the simulation results plotted as output of the program.

A note on run time: the simulation spends a lot of time computing each villager's vision as they move. One way to run 
the program faster is to change how often villagers look around. This can be done in `mover.py`, in the `towards()` 
method. The modulo in `towards()` (see below) is telling villagers to look around every four steps. You can increase
this number if you want villagers to look around less often. (Caution: if villagers look around too infrequently, they
may not remember the structures they passed at all.)

```
            if step % 4 == 0:
                self._memories.combine(self._vision.look_around())
```


## Code Structure
